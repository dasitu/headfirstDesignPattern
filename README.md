# Head First Design Pattern Notes


##Principles
1. Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same
   take the parts that vary and encapsulate them, so that later you can alter or extend the parts that vary without affecting those that do not
2. Program to an interface, not an implementation
3. Favor composition over inheritance

##OO Basics  
* polymorphism
* inheritance
* abstraction
* encapsulation

##OO Principles
1. Encapsulate what varies
2. Favor composition over inheritance
3. Program to interface, not implementations

##OO Patterns  
* **Strategy** - defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
* **Observer** - defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
